        Development of a Venom film, a spin-off from the Spider-Man film franchise, first began with producer Avi
        Arad in 2007. After various iterations, work on a new version began in March 2017 to start a new shared
        universe featuring the Marvel characters to which Sony possessed the film rights, though Sony also intends
        for the film to share the world of Spider-Man: Homecoming, which is set in the MCU after a deal between Sony
        and Marvel Studios. Rosenberg and Pinkner were set to write, with Fleischer and Hardy added in May 2017.
         Principal photography began in October 2017, taking place in Atlanta, New York City, and San Francisco.</p>
